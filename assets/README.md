CRYSTAL GUESSING GAME

Upon beginning, populate crystals with randomized values unknown to the user. These values are clickable, and the user must click them to find out their values. The computer has a randomized guess that populates as the users goal to reach. If the user goes over the value, they lose and losses are incremented by one. If they get it right, their wins are incremented by one, and in both cases the game starts over.
